# Team Member Photos

Place team member photos in this directory with the following names:

1. `sarah-mitchell.jpg` - Dr. Sarah Mitchell (or replace with actual team member)
2. `james-rodriguez.jpg` - James Rodriguez (or replace with actual team member)
3. `emily-chen.jpg` - Dr. Emily Chen (or replace with actual team member)
4. `michael-thompson.jpg` - Michael Thompson (or replace with actual team member)

## Image Guidelines

- **Format:** JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size:** 500x500px minimum (square aspect ratio works best)
- **Quality:** High resolution, well-lit professional headshots
- **Background:** Neutral or blurred background recommended

## Fallback Behavior

If images are not found, the component will display initials in a colored circle as a placeholder.

## Updating Team Members

To update team member information, edit `/src/components/Team.jsx` and modify the `teamMembers` array.
